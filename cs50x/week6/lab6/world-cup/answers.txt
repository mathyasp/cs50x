Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

France and Croatia, though they were among the actual top 3 teams, did not significantly change in their predictive positions.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seemed like the chances leveled off after 10,000 so I would probably leave it there. The time was also minimal, at just shy of 1 second.
